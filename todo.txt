pose_estimation:
- change bgr sensor msg to rgb?
- change the webcam name instead of dynamic number
- create a namespace for the mapping of ids with turtles
- pass cam intrinsics as parameter

scene_perception:
- implement ov object detection to obtain obstacles bounding boxes 
    - remove boxes around robots, markers, and object
    - track the obstacles-objects and detect changes
    - transform to world frame 
- segment manipulating object
    - obtain countour
    - transform to object frame   

optimizer/gtsam:
- obtain goal pose from user
- move scenesubscriber to vlmclient: 
    - optimise-proj_goal and proj_traj
    - draw yaw angle directions and range (-pi to pi)
- recording code for experiments 
- change gactor graph to consider obstacles bounding boxes from BBOX
- contruct fg for switch mode trajectories
- check time for translation/rotation
- check ensure angle range
- Complete optimizer.h code

action-planning/vlm_model:
- ToDo: timig/descritization of path. When to query VLM?
- VLM call: 
    - robot always faces normal to object. Compare manipulation direction with positioning of robots around objects and the resultant force. Action switch required? 
    - define high level switch_contact_points actions: right-centre, right-left, right-right, left-centre, left-left, left-right
    - How to asses scene obstacles/weight/friction into account?

experiments:
- objects (square box-different sizes, t-shaped, rectangle)
- weight: fill package with to weigh differently

repository organisation:
- document sam2 cloning and fix abs path
- create a python env and run python files from env
- create python env requirements file and update requirements installation in README.md
- update c++ packages requirements in README.md
- update citations on code files
- remove unnecessary headers and info
- add file purpose headers

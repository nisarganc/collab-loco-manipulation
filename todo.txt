pose_estimation:
- does aruco_detection uses bgr or rgb?
- does sensor_msg/Image always in bgr encoding?
- change the webcam name instead of dynamic number

scene_perception:
- first frame
    - transform obstacles to world frame 
    - colour the countours
- !first frame
    - track the obstacles and detect changes

optimizer/gtsam:
- obtain goal pose from user
- move scenesubscriber to vlmclient: 
    - optimise-proj_goal and proj_traj
    - draw yaw angle directions and range (-pi to pi)

- change factor graph to consider obstacles bounding boxes from scene_perception
- contruct fg for switch mode trajectories
- check time for translation/rotation
- check ensure angle range
- Complete optimizer.h code

action-planning/vlm_model:
- ToDo: planning and replanning with VLM?
- VLM call: 
    - robot always faces normal to object. 
    - Compare manipulation direction with positioning of robots around objects and the resultant force. 
    - Action switch required? 
    - Pick colours on the countour of object

experiments:
- recording code for experiments 
- objects (square box-different sizes, t-shaped, rectangle)
- weight: fill package with to weigh differently
- How to asses scene obstacles/weight/shape/friction

repository organisation:
- document sam2 cloning and fix abs path
- create a python env and run python files from env
- create python env requirements file and update requirements installation in README.md
- update c++ packages requirements in README.md
- update citations on code files
- remove unnecessary headers and info
- add file purpose headers

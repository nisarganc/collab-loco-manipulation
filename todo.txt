pose_estimation:
Fix the webcam name instead of number
Handle exception case where 0 marker is not detected
    - Detect and estimate marker0 only once
    - Fix the poses pulishing rate
publish obstacle poses
Improve marker labels    

Approach: multi-robot-push:
- Given: dimensions of obstacle and object
- Input: start and goal desciption: map cordinates
- Centroid trajectory planning:
    - GTSAM centroid ref traj
    - overlay trajectory and goal position
- mid level planning: 
    - Think of a logic to trigger a VLM server call to deliver high-level switch contact point actions
    - define high level switch_contacts actions
    - robots should be always in touch with object to avoid slipping
    - GTSAM to generate trajectory for each hl actions? use Box 60.2*65.2 dimension to generate switch_contacts action trajectory->velocity commands.
    - find nav controller
- Low level controller
    - ROS2 cmd_vel with constant vel (1.0) and sleep (Ts_translation). Test how long does the specific box move.

real world robots:
Robot radius ignored in vlm
check if robot frame and aruco frame coincide with each other?
check if increasing k results in smooth traj?

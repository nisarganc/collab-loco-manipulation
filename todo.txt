pose_estimation:
- Change the webcam name instead of dynamic number
- Decide a aruco_poses pulishing and frame rate
- Remove waitkey(1) and imshow?
- Better logic for ProjectGoalPose?
- Draw yaw angle directions and range
- Overlay arrow from current object pose to goal pose or think of diffusion models to gen traj on image

mrcap:
- clean the code setup and changes

vlm_model:
- ToDo: TIMING AND DESCRITIZATION OF PATH
- START LOOP
    - VLM call: 
        - Robot always faces normal to object. Compare manipulation direction with positioning of robots around objects and the resultant force. Action switch required? 
        - Define high level switch_contact_points actions: right-centre, right-left, right-right, left-centre, left-left, left-right
        - How to asses scene obstacles/weight/friction into account?
    - Low level controller each hl actions? 
        - use Box 60.2*65.2 dimension to generate switch_contacts action trajectory->velocity commands.
        - ROS2 cmd_vel with constant vel (1.0) and sleep (Ts_translation). Test how long does the specific box move.
- END LOOP

README.md:
update requirements file for python
update c++ packages requirements

VLM Advantages:
- Dynamic obstacles/scene
- Different weights and shape of manipulating object

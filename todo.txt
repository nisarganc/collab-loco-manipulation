pose_estimation:
Fix the webcam name instead of number
Handle exception case where 0 marker is not detected
    - detect and estimate marker0 only once
    - Fix the poses pulishing rate

mrcap:
Fix fg equation: no rotation while generating centroid control commands
check quaternions conversions in roscommunication file
create srv client:
- msg: "The pose of turtle2 with marker-id {} is {}, turtle4 with marker-id {} is {}, and turtle6 with marker-id {} is {}. The pose of manipulating object with marker-id {} is {}. Please return control commands of all turtles such that next pose of manipulating object with marker-id {} is{}. All poses follow this syntax (x, y, yaw). Note that yaw angle of robots can be between -pi to pi according to right hand tumb rule."

Response_behavior function: 
- How to handle sync of control commands, time duration of execution and sequence of control commands. 

real world robots:
check if robot frame and aruco frame coincide with each other?
check if increasing k results in smooth traj?

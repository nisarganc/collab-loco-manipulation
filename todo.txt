pose_estimation:
Fix the webcam name instead of number
Handle exception case when marker0 is not detected
    - Detect and estimate marker0 only once
    - Fix the poses pulishing rate
publish obstacle poses
Improve marker labels    

Approach: multi-robot-push:
- Given: dimensions of obstacle and object
- Input: start and goal desciption: in world cordinates
- Centroid trajectory planning:
    - GTSAM centroid ref traj
    - overlay trajectory with direction vector arrow and goal position
- mid level planning: 
    - Think of a logic as to when to trigger a VLM server call to deliver high-level switch contact point actions
    - define high level switch_contacts actions: 
        - robot always faces normal to object
        - right-centre, right-left, right-right, left-centre, left-left, left-right
    - GTSAM to generate trajectory for each hl actions? use Box 60.2*65.2 dimension to generate switch_contacts action trajectory->velocity commands.
    - find nav controller implementation
- Low level controller
    - ROS2 cmd_vel with constant vel (1.0) and sleep (Ts_translation). Test how long does the specific box move.

Real world robots:
check if robot frame and aruco frame coincide with each other?
check if increasing k results in smooth traj?

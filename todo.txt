pose_estimation:
- Change the webcam name instead of dynamic number
- Decide a aruco_poses pulishing rate
- Improve marker labels and axis  
- can reduce markers dimension when 3D printing?
- Remove waitkey(1) and imshow?
- test theta values

Approach: multi-robot-push:
TIMING AND DESCRITIZATION OF PATH
- Input: start and goal desciption: in world cordinates
START LOOP
- Initial centroid trajectory planning:
    - Overlay arrow from current object pose to goal pose
    - VLM server call: Robot always faces normal to object. Compare object manipulation arrow direction with positioning of robots around objects. Take obstacles into account. Action switch required? 
        - define high level switch_contact_points actions: 
        - right-centre, right-left, right-right, left-centre, left-left, left-right
    - GTSAM to generate trajectory for each hl actions? use Box 60.2*65.2 dimension to generate switch_contacts action trajectory->velocity commands.
    - find nav controller implementation
- Low level controller
    - ROS2 cmd_vel with constant vel (1.0) and sleep (Ts_translation). Test how long does the specific box move.
END LOOP

Real world robots:
check if robot frame and aruco frame coincide with each other?
check if increasing k results in smooth traj?
